		<h1 style="text-align: center;">Assignment 3</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, you will be training your own NeRF or Gaussian Splatting. 
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/bmild/nerf">NeRF</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/">3DGS</a></li>
			</ul>
			We have made available a visualization tool using the Three.js library implemented in "./js/assignment3.js" and an example NerfStudio Colab can be found <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13ZUOVo9N4fjZcoS_R9N0BsYa2kV6ywuq?usp=sharing">here</a>. You have the option to launch the demo either through Colab or on your local machine. It is important to note that while Colab offers free TPU access, completing the training within the free tier may not be feasible. In this assignment, your task is to collect your own data, conduct calibration, and train your NeRF/3DGS model. You are welcome to use any programming language you are comfortable with. Ensure that the final results are exported in obj/ply format for visualization.  You should then evaluate your results by comparing them with solutions from <a href="https://alicevision.org/#meshroom">Mesh Room</a> or <a href="https://colmap.github.io/">COLMAP</a>.
			<br><br>
			<b>How to Submit: </b>Please submit this template file along with your implementation as a zip file. The zip file should contain your source code, the generated results in PLY mesh format, and a report that has been modified using this HTML file. The report should comprise your results and a concise explanation of your implementation. Alternatively, you may choose to create a GitHub repository containing all these elements and provide a link for submission.
			<br><br>
			<b>Requirements / Rubric: </b>The grading is based on the correctness of your implementation. You are encouraged to use the visualization tool to debug your implementation. You can also use the visualization tool to test your implementation on other 3D models. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>+80 pts: Complete the training using your own data. </li>
					<li>+20 pts: Write up your project, algorithms, reporting results (reprojection error) and visualisations, compare your reconstruction with open source software Colmap.</li>
					<li>+10 pts: Extra credit (see below)</li>
					<li>-5*n pts: Lose 5 points for every time (after the first) you do not follow the instructions for the hand in format</li>
				</ul>
			<b>Extract Credit:</b> You are free to complete any extra credit:
				<ul>
					<li>up to 5 pts: Present results with your own captured data.</li>
					<li>up to 10 pts: Train your models with both Nerf and 3DGS.</li>
					<li>up to 20 pts: Train your model with language embedding (e.g., LERF).</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>My Results</h2>
<p>This project utilized the Carla simulator to collect a dataset from the Town10HD map, comprising 378 images split evenly between aerial and street views, which formed the basis for constructing a 3D scene using both Colmap and NeRF techniques.</p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>The dataset consists of 378 images captured from two perspectives: Aerial view and Street view. These images were sourced from the <a href="https://carla.org/">Carla Simulator</a>, specifically from the Town10HD map. Below is a GIF that illustrates all the input views:</p>

<h3>COLMAP Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Using the known camera poses, a 3D model was built with COLMAP. The accurate camera poses enabled a high-quality point cloud, indicating a precise reconstruction in alignment with the real-world scene layout.</p>

<h3>NeRF</h3>
<p>NeRF Studio was used for training a vanilla NeRF model based on the initial COLMAP results. The training configuration was as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Iterations: 30,000</li>
	<li>Optimizer: Adam, starting learning rate of 0.01, with exponential decay</li>
	<li>Precision: Mixed precision for efficient training</li>
</ul>
<p>Further configuration details for the NeRF model include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Base Resolution: 16</li>
	<li>Maximum Resolution: 2048</li>
	<li>Number of Levels: 16</li>
	<li>Hidden Dimensions: 64 for both density and color</li>
</ul>
<p>The NeRF model effectively generated a 3D representation of the scene, capturing both geometric and photometric details accurately. Below is a GIF that showcases the NeRF results:</p>

<h3>3D Gaussian Splatting</h3>
<p>3D Gaussian Splatting is a volumetric rendering technique optimized for achieving high-quality geometric reconstructions. The training configuration for this model includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Iterations: 30,000</li>
	<li>Checkpoint Iterations: Every 7,000 iterations up to 30,000</li>
	<li>Learning Rate Adjustments: Position learning rate starts at 0.00016 and decays exponentially to 0.0000016, while feature, opacity, scaling, and rotation rates are individually tuned for optimal results</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of structure optimization:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Density and Opacity Adjustments: Performed at specified intervals, with mechanisms to increase density and reset opacity to handle areas of low information</li>
	<li>Loss Function: Utilizes a lambda DSSIM parameter of 0.2 to balance fidelity and computational efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting 3D reconstructions from Gaussian Splatting are generally more accurate in terms of geometry compared to those from NeRF. The main difference lies in how the techniques handle areas with sparse information. Unlike NeRF, which attempts to interpolate and fill these areas with estimated colors, 3D Gaussian Splatting leaves them black, showcasing no information. Below is a GIF that showcases the results:</p>

<h3>Extra Credit Summary</h3>
<p>For extra credit, 1. I captured my own dataset and 2. conducted training using both NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques.</p>
